 - The dataset has 480 sequences, for a total of 42,240 instances. Each activity contains 15 RSS data temporal segments. It also takes into account two forms of bending exercise. Supplementary figures depict the sensor node placements and associated identifiers.
 - The raw data is processed to obtain time-domain characteristics. This process employs a 250-millisecond epoch time and collects 5 RSS samples from each pair of WSN nodes. Each reciprocal RSS reading's mean value and variance are among the attributes.
 - The visual below illustrates the positions of the sensors.
